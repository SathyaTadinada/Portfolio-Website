## Overview

This repository contains two distinct types of code/content:

1. **Tailwind UI Template Code**: Portions of this project originate from the **Spotlight** template by [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight), which is a commercial product licensed to me (Sathya Tadinada) under the [**Tailwind UI Personal License**](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
2. **Custom Code and Additions**: All code, content, and features I've created on top of the original template are licensed under the **MIT License** (see below).

## Tailwind UI Components

The Tailwind UI components and template files included here are _not_ open source. They remain subject to the [Tailwind UI License](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license) and **may not** be redistributed, sublicensed, or used without purchasing your own Tailwind UI license.

In short:
- You may view these files for reference.
- You may **not** copy, reuse, or redistribute Tailwind UI template/component code unless you have your own Tailwind UI license.

## Custom Code and Additions (MIT License)
All code I have written myself (including but not limited to new components, styling, functionality, and configuration) is released under the MIT License:
