## Design and Contributors

This site began as the **Spotlight** template from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight), but has been significantly customized and extended to include my own layout changes, blog functionality, tag filtering, and more. 

While the vast majority of the code, design, and content for this site was created by me, I welcome occasional contributions and use [automated tools](https://github.com/dependabot) to help maintain the project.

## License

The original **Spotlight** template is a commercial product licensed under the [Tailwind UI license](https://tailwindui.com/license). Customizations and additional features in this repository are my own work.
