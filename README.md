## Design and Origin

This site began as the **Spotlight** template from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight), but has been significantly customized and extended to include my own layout changes, blog functionality, tag filtering, and more.

## License

The original **Spotlight** template is a commercial product licensed under the [Tailwind UI license](https://tailwindui.com/license). Customizations and additional features in this repository are my own work.
